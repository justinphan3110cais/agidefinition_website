Despite this difference, we include these tasks because we believe the ability to translate abstract concepts into novel visual information is a critical component of general intelligence in the modern era. Therefore, the AI's output is assessed not as a direct analogue of human ability, but as a measurable proxy for its capacity for high-level conceptual and imaginative synthesis.",
